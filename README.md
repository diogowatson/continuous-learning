# Continuous Learning

On a personal level, continuous learning is about the constant expansion of skills and skill-sets through learning and increasing knowledge.

## DevOps

DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and services.

### Chef

Chef is a configuration management and automation platform. Chef helps you describe your infrastructure with code (IaC). Because your infrastructure is managed with code, it is flexible, versionable, and human-readable. Also, it can be automated, tested and reproduced with ease.
