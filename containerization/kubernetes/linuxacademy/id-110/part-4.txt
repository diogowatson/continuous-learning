# Images
$ docker pull centos
$ docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2
$ docker tag ubuntu localhost:5000/ubuntu
$ docker push localhost:5000/ubuntu
$ docker pull localhost:5000/ubuntu
$ docker stop registry

## Best Practices
- Use .dockerignore;
- Containers should be ephemeral;
- Never install unnecessary packages;
- Each container for a single purpose (use docker container network to communicate);
- Minimize no of layers;
- Build cache (for no cache use: --no-cache=true)

## Working with Images
- FROM: 
    - Define the base image to start the build process.
- RUN: 
    - It takes a command as its argument and runs during the build of the docker file
- ADD:
    - Gets two arguments: source and destination
    - Copy files from source onto the containers file system
    - Accepts as a source: URL, file, folder, and a recognized archive type
- COPY:
    - Similar to the ADD
    - Use COPY instruction individually so that each build starts cache is only invalidated if those files change
    - COPY vs ADD:
        - ADD allows tar files and URLs
        - Docker prefer you use COPY because it's more transparent than ADD
        - Best use for ADD is local tar file extraction: ADD file.tar.gz /.
- WORKDIR and USER:
    - WORKDIR directive is used to set where the command defined with CMD should be executed. It's the working directory
    - USER directive is used to set the UID or username which is to run the container based on the image being built.
- CMD:
    - Similar to RUN
    - Executed when the container is instantiated
    - Should be considered as an initial default command that gets run when the container is created from the image
    - Considered as a default and replaces any command which is passed during the creation
- ENTRYPOINT:
    - Sets the default application used every time a container is created using the image
    - If you have a specific application per container use the ENTRYPOINT to start the application when the container runs
    - CMD vs ENTRYPOINT:
        -
